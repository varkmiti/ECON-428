Verify the relevance and exogeneity of $\\u{X}$ as an instrument for $\\tilde{X}$.\n",

    "- Exogeneity: $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\u{X}U\\right] = 0$\n",

    "&= \\mathbb{E}\\left[X^2\\right] \\neq 0\n",
    "\\end{align}$\n",
    "Now, someone asked on Ed if we can assume that $var{X} > 0$, which we can. This it is clear that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\u{X}\\tilde{X}\\right] \\neq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we verify exogeneity:\n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",

    "&= \\mathbb{E}\\left[XU\\right] + 0 \\\\\n",
